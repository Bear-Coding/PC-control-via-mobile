# PC-control-via-mobile

- The "PC" directory contains the software to be used on PC.
The "Mobile" directory contains the application to be used on mobile(currently only for android).
The "Server" directory contains the PHP files to connect with the database from the mobile app.


## Requirements to get the project working: 
- Create a database(Local or online if you own host), add the required tables/fields(Will be updated from time to time).
- Edit the "connection.php" file, add your own database/host details.

## ToDo list:
- Login/Register for the phone version. - Done
- Approve the "connection" via code or just accept something (PC version).
- Update the database so it logs all commands.
